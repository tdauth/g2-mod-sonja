## TODOs

* Add Sonja to all other world and apply her stats, skills, XP, level, learn points and inventory when changing the world.
* Add a custom castle in a new world which can be bought for Sonja with guards etc.
* Add options to give her and make her use permanent potions or herbs.
* The skill "Womanizer" needs to be more balanced and give some useful gold, XP and items. Add the dialog option to more ambient NPCs.
* Add more items and collect item options to the dialog of Sonja.
* Integrate the patch menu and let the user configure the days until you can do some actions in the dialog.
* Fix the summon and teleport runes.
* Add more companions to be purchased from Sonja like a mage, warrior, archer etc.
* Add a real NSIS based installer (see [documentation](https://wiki.worldofgothic.de/doku.php?id=nsis)).
* German dubbing. Find German voice actors for Sonja and the hero after completing all dialogs.
